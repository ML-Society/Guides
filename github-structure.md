# GitHub Structure

## Rough Guidelines

- On the top level we have `Ground Zero` and `In-Too-Deep`, the `Guides` folder and all repos for each project
- Project specific Github project trackers should be created "within" that project repo
- Project members will be given `Member` access roles to organisation and `write` access to specific projects they are working on.
- Project managers will be given `Admin` access roles to the organisation so that they can add/remove team members for the projects they are currently managing.
