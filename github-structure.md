# GitHub Structure

## Rough Guidelines

- On the top level we have `Ground Zero` and `In-Too-Deep`, the `Guides` folder and all repos for each project
- Project specific Github project trackers should be created "within" that project repo
- Project members will be given `Member` access roles to organisation and `write` access to specific projects they are working on.
- Committee members will be given `Admin` access roles to the organisation.
