- It is a good idea to not clutter the board with many cards, if what you want to add is relevant to an existing card, simply use the elipses menu (`...`) on the card to edit it.

- A card can be moved to different columns depending on its status by simple drag-and-drop!

- The project's progress breakdown is available in the top-left corner
